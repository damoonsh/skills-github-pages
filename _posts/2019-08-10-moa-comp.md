title: "Advancing Drug Discovery with Mechanism of Action (MoA) Prediction"
date: 2019-08-10

# Introduction and Context
The Connectivity Map project, in collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), and the NIH Common Funds LINCS, launched a competition to improve Mechanism of Action (MoA) prediction algorithms for drug development. Unlike traditional drug discovery methods, which were often serendipitous, modern approaches target specific biological mechanisms associated with diseases. Identifying a drug’s MoA helps researchers understand its impact on cellular biology, essential for developing effective treatments.

In this challenge, competitors use a unique dataset that includes gene expression and cell viability data across 100 cell types for over 5,000 drugs. The objective is to create a multi-label classification algorithm that can accurately label each drug with its MoA by analyzing cellular responses. Solutions will be evaluated based on logarithmic loss across drug-MoA annotation pairs. Success in this competition could significantly enhance automated MoA prediction, accelerating the drug discovery process.
